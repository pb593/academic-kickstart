An issue with this approach is choosing the number of latent processes and their kernels. These choices are typically done manually, which can be time consuming and prone to human biases. We propose Gaussian Process Automatic Latent Process Selection (GP-ALPS), which automatically chooses the latent processes by turning off those that do not meaningfully contribute to explaining the data. We develop a variational inference scheme, assess the quality of the variational posterior by comparing it against the gold standard MCMC, and demonstrate the suitability of GP-ALPS in a set of preliminary experiments.","tags":[],"title":"GP-ALPS: Automatic Latent Process Selection for Multi-Output Gaussian Process Models","type":"publication"}]
