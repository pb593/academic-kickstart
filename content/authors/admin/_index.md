I am a Machine Learning Researcher at [Invenia Labs](http://invenialabs.co.uk/), where my role is to study the dynamics of electricity grids using Bayesian statistics. 

My research interests include probabilistic modelling of spatiotemporal data, Gaussian processes, approximate inference and model-based reinforcement learning.

I hold an MSc in [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/current_students/specialist_msc_programmes/msc_csml/) from the University College London, where my advisor was [Professor John Shawe-Taylor](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.shawe-taylor/).
